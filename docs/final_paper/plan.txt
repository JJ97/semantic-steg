    - what is lexical steg
    - what is it used for
    - whats wrong with current methods

introduction
    - why is the work important?
        - ties to encryption, safety, part of any good security policy, watermarking
    - why now?
        - explosion in ml nlp research
            - nmt highly successful   
        - ml applications for image
    - why canâ€™t you use what exists already?
        - it sucks ass
        - nobody has tried it with ml
    - techniques and viewpoints
        - approach from a nmt perspective
            - i.e. goal is english->english translation
            - essentially create a generative model of text
                - conditioned on some pre-existing text in order to generate similar output texts
                - modify this model to embed message during generation (similar approach successful in image steg)
    - contribution
        - novel application of adversarial autoencoders to the problem of lexical steganography
        - better than prior work (hopefully)
        - model can also be modified for other applications e.g. password cracking, 
related work
    1. Can you list (and critically discuss) relevant work?
    2. Can you organize the different pieces of earlier work
    into categories? (e.g. having same research direction)
    3. Can you relate work together and can you relate your
    work to that of others?
