   <p> <b> Description:</b> Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are important tools in machine learning, seeing recent success in a wide variety of applications, from synthesizing realistic images of human faces and house interiors, to transforming photos from summer to winter and night to day. In a GAN, the learning task is modelled as a game in which a generator network aims to realistically mimic samples from some high-dimensional distribution. A discriminator network is then tasked with determining if a given sample is produced by the original distribution or the generator. Both networks are trained in tandem, with an improvement in one network encouraging an improvement in the other. Within the information security sector, GANs have been used for learning novel encryption schemes, modelling password distributions, and steganography techniques for hiding information within an image. This project will expand upon current research, experimenting with new applications of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, such as developing a steganographic algorithm that hides information within text instead of images or using side-information to improve a password modelling network. </p>
